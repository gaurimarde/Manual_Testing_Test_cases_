I wrote detailed test cases to check all the main features of the app, like logging in, viewing products, adding items to the cart, and checking out.
I followed my test cases step by step to see if everything in the app worked correctly.
When I found something that didn’t work, I wrote a report explaining the problem so it could be fixed.
After bugs were fixed, I tested the app again to make sure the fixes worked and didn’t cause new problems.
I used tools to automate some of the tests, making it quicker and easier to check the app regularly.
I tested the app on various devices, like phones and tablets, to ensure it looked good and was easy to use on all platforms.
I maintained detailed records of all the tests performed and any issues found to ensure a clear and organized workflow.
