This repository contains a collection of test cases for different topics.
As part of my coursework, I worked on a project focused on quality assurance (QA) testing . The goal was to ensure that the app functions properly and provides a great user experience.
I wrote detailed test cases to check all the main features of the app, like logging in, viewing products, adding items to the cart, and checking out.
I followed my test cases step by step to see if everything in the app worked correctly.
